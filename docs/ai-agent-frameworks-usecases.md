)

writer = Agent(
    role='Content Writer',
    goal='Create compelling content',
    backstory='Professional writer'
)

# Define tasks
research_task = Task(
    description='Research the topic',
    agent=researcher
)

writing_task = Task(
    description='Write an article',
    agent=writer
)

# Create crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task]
)

# Execute
result = crew.kickoff()
```

### Template 3: Conversational Agent

```python
# Using AutoGen
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent

# Create assistant
assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config={"model": "gpt-4"}
)

# Create user proxy
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user",
    human_input_mode="NEVER"
