# Installing SurfSense

SurfSense offers multiple installation options to suit your needs. All self-hosted installations require the repository to be cloned first.

## Quick Start Scripts (Recommended for New Users)

The easiest way to get started with SurfSense is using our automated quick-start scripts:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MODSetter/SurfSense
cd SurfSense
./quick-start.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/MODSetter/SurfSense
cd SurfSense
quick-start.bat
```

These scripts will automatically:
- Create all necessary `.env` files from examples
- Generate secure random passwords
- Guide you through the remaining configuration steps

After running the script, simply add your API keys as instructed and start the services with `docker compose up -d`.

## Docker Installation 

This method provides a containerized environment with all dependencies pre-configured. Less Customization.

## Manual Installation (Preferred)

For users who prefer more control over the installation process or need to customize their setup, we also provide manual installation instructions.
